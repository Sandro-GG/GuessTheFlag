ðŸŽŒ Guess the Flag â€” A Flag Guessing Game in SwiftUI

This is a simple and engaging flag guessing game built as part of the 100 Days of SwiftUI challenge (Day 21).

The app displays three random flags and asks the user to tap the correct one. It tracks the userâ€™s score across eight rounds and gives feedback after each selection. After the final round, the game shows the total score and offers an option to restart.
