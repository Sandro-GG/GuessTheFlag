# 🎌 Guess the Flag — A Flag Guessing Game in SwiftUI

A simple and engaging flag guessing game. The app displays three random flags and asks the user to tap the correct one. It tracks the user’s score across eight rounds and gives feedback after each selection. After the final round, the game shows the total score and offers an option to restart.
